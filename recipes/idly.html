    <h2>What is Idly?</h2>
    <p>Idli or idly is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular
        as breakfast foods in Eastern and Southern India and in Sri Lanka.</p>

    <p>The cakes are made by steaming a batter
        consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so
        that they are more readily metabolised by the body.</p>
    <h2>How is it served?</h2>
    <p>Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with chutneys
        (coconut based), sambar and Medu vada. <br>However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste, it is also
        often served with kaara chutney (onion based) or spicy fish curries. The dry spice mixture podi is convenient
        while travelling</p>
